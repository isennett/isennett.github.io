NOTE TO GRADER: after pushing content to page prior to the deadline I found a problem
with the resume when viewing it from different computers. The version I pushed 
before the deadline is complete and meets the specs but I made it a lot better 
and fixed the problems I discovered. Grade which ever one you want. Thanks!

Pretty sure its all correct

got help from TAs and Grad students
